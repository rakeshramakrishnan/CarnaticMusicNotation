CarnaticMusicNotation
=====================

This project aims to create a context sensitive OOP Toolkit for Carnatic Music Notation

Users can enter notes of a Carnatic song either by :
1. Typing it manually using their own set of definitions and conventions
2. Giving a MIDI file as input

Note: This project CANNOT be used to enter notations of western music. The context in which the notes are organized are based on Carnatic music theory. Hence, it is to be used to enter notes of Carnatic music.

However, one can give their own names to swaras (eg. Ri can be 'R' or 'Ri' or 'D' and so on...) and also choose how special characters like upper and lower octave characters, quarter notes appear in the music score.

Search 'Carnatic Music Notation' in google to get an idea of what the current notation scheme is. This project is just an extension of the above scheme with the added flixibility that one can choose what letters appear for each of the swarams.
